IOLoop optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IOLoop optimizations to reduce latency. Reduced the amount of roundtrips
through the IOLoop required to finish a request by performing some
callbacks synchronously. In particular, future done callbacks are usually
safe to perform synchronously since that's what most Future implementations
do anyway. Improved the fairness of the IOLoop schedule regarding timeouts,
to reduce the maximum request latency when under constant pressure.
